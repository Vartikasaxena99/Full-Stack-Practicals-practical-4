        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others. Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.
        JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.The language was initially called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript. There are many programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. In fact, JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated. Java is a very complex programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. The syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced by the programming language C.
